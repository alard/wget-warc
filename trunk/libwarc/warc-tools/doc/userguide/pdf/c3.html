>&#13;  The warc-tools is a library containing a set of functions that allow to store data and retrieve them from WARC files. A WARC file is an archive file stored in the WARC (Web ARChive) format. It is a concatenation of several data block where each one is  encapsulated with a text header containing information about the data block itself and/or about the WARC file containing it. An encapsulated data block is then called a WARC Record. Thus, with the warc-tools library, we have access to functions that will permit us to create WARC Records from a given data file that we want to archive, and also to store it in an existing or a new WARC file. In addition, we have access to an other kind of functions that will allow us to retrieve WARC Records from an existing WARC file and to extract the data stored in it.
   </P
><P
>&#13;   Also, this library allows us to access and read file stored respecting the old ARC archiving format, from which the WARC format was born. It offers functions to access
   records stored in such files and retrieve the data blocks they contain too.
   </P
><P
>&#13;   In the following, we give a description of every application and function offered with the warc-tools to the user in order to archive data in the
   WARC format, to retrieve WARC Records stored in a WARC file, or, if he has archives in the ARC format, we describe how to use our own ARC files reader to get their data.
